However, kernels represent other measures of similarity.  For example, the Gaussian RBF kernel is a measure of the closeness of the endpoints of two vectors.  It is maximized (at 1) when the vectors' endpoints are identical and minimized (at 0) when the vectors' endpoints are infitely far apart.

    "## Practical Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Size\n",
    "SVMs work best in high-dimensional input spaces where the number of observations (the number of data points) is greater than the number of features (the number of dimensions of the input space), but as long as the number of observations isn't too much less than the number of features.  Professor Andrew Ng of Stanford recommends the following guidelines for using SVMs in classification problems: \n",
    "\n",
    "Given a number of features $n$ and a number of observations $m$, \n",
    "\n",
    "* If $n \\gg m$, use logistic regression or SVM without a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $n \\in [1,1000]$ and $m \\in [10,10000]$, use SVM with a Gaussian kernel. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If $n \\ll m$, say, $n \\in [1,1000]$ and $m < 50000$, use logistic regression or SVM without a kernel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "Moreover, choosing the kernel parameters (say, the width of a Gaussian kernel) and the amount of regularization (or, conversely, the strength of the hinge function) can have significant effects on the performance of an SVM model.  If the regularization term dominates the cost function, the decision boundary will be smooth, but the model is more likely to misclassify data.  If the hinge term dominates, the model will be more likely to classify all data correctly, but the decision boundary will be more complicated and prone to overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling\n",
    "SVMs are scale-dependent, so in general, one should scale the training data and apply the same scaling to the test data when employing a support vector machine."
